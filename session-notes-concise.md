## Key Proof Strategies Learned

### Cycle Contradiction (single edge graphs)
Any closed walk must traverse the only edge twice → violates IsTrail.

### Non-Coboundary via Walk Sum
1. Walk sum of coboundary on closed walk = 0 (telescopes)
2. Walk sum of cycle indicator = cycle length ≥ 3
3. Contradiction

### Trail Uniqueness for Counting
In a trail, each edge appears once → `countP (edge eq) = 1` → prove uniqueness.

### Compositional Verification
Two forests + ≤1 connecting edge = still a forest → H¹ = 0 preserved.

### Barrier Detection
Hollow triangle (3 pairwise compatible, no global) → H¹ ≅ ℤ ≠ 0 → no value adjustment works.

### Curvature Analysis
- Curvature κ = (disagreement - 2ε) / (4ε + 1) when disagreement > 2ε, else 0
- High curvature (κ > 1/2) indicates nearby barriers
- Low curvature everywhere (κ < 1/10) implies no barriers
- H1Trivial → all curvatures = 0 (flat landscape)

### Critical Point Analysis (Morse Theory)
- Misalignment function = sum of squared excesses over 2ε threshold
- Zero misalignment ⟺ H1Trivial (all pairs agree within 2ε)
- Global minimum has zero misalignment (uniform system achieves 0)
- Saddle points have escape directions (Morse theory)
- Gradient zero when aligned (all disagreements ≤ 2ε → no contribution)

### Bifurcation Analysis
- Critical epsilon εc = maxDisagreement / 2
- alignmentStatus = (maxDisagreement ≤ 2ε)
- Above εc: aligned, Below εc: misaligned
- Safety margin = |ε - εc| / ε
- Non-negativity: sup' of abs values ≥ 0 (chain: 0 ≤ |x| ≤ sup')

### Hysteresis Analysis
- Simple alignment has NO hysteresis (state depends only on current ε)
- Path-independence: final state depends only on destination, not path taken
- Reversibility: all transitions can be undone
- Memory effects: zero for static alignment, possible for dynamic/learning systems
- Hysteresis width = 0 for memoryless systems

### Attractor Basin Analysis
- Attractor = stable aligned configuration (zero misalignment)
- Basin = region of initial conditions that flow to an attractor
- Basin radius = ε (tolerance parameter)
- Distance to boundary = max(0, ε - distance to attractor)
- Consensus is always an attractor: all agents with same values → uniform system → zero misalignment
- Proof via `CriticalPoints.uniform_misalignment_zero_ax` axiom
- Stability classification: veryStable (radius > ε), stable (> ε/2), marginal (> ε/10), unstable

### Escape Time Analysis
- Escape time = steps to go from misaligned to aligned
- Convergence rate = 4/5 (misalignment decreases by factor of 0.8 per step)
- Rate bounds proven: 0 < rate < 1 (guarantees convergence)
- Escape time = log(initial/tolerance) / log(1/rate)
- Upper/lower bounds for planning and budgeting
- Progress tracking: actual vs expected misalignment
- Forecasting: predict misalignment at future steps
- Zero misalignment → zero escape time (proven directly)
- Axioms used: finiteness, monotonicity, worst-case bound (rational arithmetic)

### Recurrence Analysis
- Recurrence = returning to misalignment after being aligned
- Recurrence probability based on distance to basin boundary
- Large margin (> ε) → low recurrence risk (5%)
- Small margin (< ε/5) → high recurrence risk (25%)
- No perturbation → no recurrence (alignment is permanent)
- Gradient descent is dissipative, not Poincaré recurrent
- Triggers: parameter drift, agent shift, external shock, accumulation
- Prevention: maintain margin, monitor parameters, periodic re-alignment
- Key insight: recurrence requires external perturbation

### Entropy Production Analysis
- Alignment entropy = normalized disagreement measure in [0, 1]
- Zero entropy ⟺ perfect consensus (all agents agree)
- Entropy production rate = (1 - entropy) × 0.01 (max 1% per step)
- Second Law of Alignment: entropy tends to increase (proven non-negative rate)
- Half-life = time until 50% degradation
- Maintenance interval = time before entropy exceeds threshold
- Consensus minimizes entropy (proven: uniform values → zero entropy)
- Key insight: same entropy implies same production rate in simplified model

### Fluctuation Bounds Analysis (Batch 25)
- Statistical mechanics approach to alignment monitoring
- Expected alignment = 1 - entropy (center of distribution)
- Variance = 1 / (4 * n * |S|) for n agents, |S| situations
- Large systems have smaller fluctuations (proven: n ≥ 10 → variance ≤ 1/40)
- Concentration inequality: P(|X - μ| > δ) ≤ σ²/δ² (Chebyshev bound)
- Confidence intervals: 68% (±1σ), 95% (±2σ), 99.7% (±3σ)
- Anomaly classification:
  - Normal (< 2σ): Within expected fluctuations
  - Mild (2-3σ): Slightly unusual, monitor
  - Significant (3-4σ): Investigate cause
  - Severe (> 4σ): Immediate attention required
- Alert thresholds based on false alarm rate
- Key insight: distinguishes normal noise from real problems

### Fairness Cohomology Analysis (Batch 26 - FIRST OF FAIRNESS ENGINE)
- Fairness as TOPOLOGICAL structure, not just constraints
- Fairness complex: vertices = agents, simplices = groups that CAN be jointly satisfied
- Fairness H¹ = 0 ↔ global fair allocation exists (main characterization)
- Fairness H¹ ≠ 0 ↔ fair allocation IMPOSSIBLE (topological obstruction)
- Scarcity impossibility: if total < n × (1/n), proportionality is impossible (proven)
- Fair-aligned = H¹(value complex) = 0 AND H¹(fairness complex) = 0
- No conflict if both achievable: alignment and fairness are independent constraints
- Fairness distance = sum of fairness violations (non-negative)
- Fairness repair = minimum cost to achieve fairness
- Key insight: check H¹ BEFORE attempting fair allocation!

### Pareto Topology Analysis (Batch 27 - FAIRNESS ENGINE 2/15)
- Pareto frontier as GEOMETRIC object, not just set
- Pareto dominance: transitive, irreflexive (partial order)
- Pareto efficient = not dominated by any feasible allocation
- Frontier dimension = n-1 for n agents (one DoF lost to efficiency)
- Curvature measures tradeoff steepness (diminishing returns)
- MRS (marginal rate of substitution) = cost to j of improving i
- Convex feasible set → connected frontier (path between efficient points)
- Fair Pareto frontier = efficient ∩ fair (can be empty!)
- Key insight: SHAPE of frontier determines tradeoff possibilities

### Envy-Freeness Analysis (Batch 28 - FAIRNESS ENGINE 3/15)
- Envy as QUANTIFIED relation (envyAmount ≥ 0, not just binary)
- Envy graph: directed graph where i → j means i envies j
- isEnvyFree ↔ envyEdgeCount = 0 (no edges in envy graph)
- Envy-free → no envy cycles (proven)
- EF1 (envy-free up to one item): bounded envy amount
- Envy-free → EF1 (for non-negative max item value)
- Proportional fairness: each agent gets ≥ 1/n of total value
- For identical valuations: envy-free → proportional (axiom)
- Envy complex: simplices = sets that CAN be simultaneously envy-free
- EFPO: envy-free AND Pareto optimal (can conflict!)
- Total envy = 0 ↔ envy-free (sum of non-negatives = 0 iff all terms = 0)
- Key insight: envy has TOPOLOGICAL structure via envy graph and complex

### Proportionality Analysis (Batch 29 - FAIRNESS ENGINE 4/15)
- Proportionality: each agent gets ≥ 1/n of total value
- Proportionality region: set of all proportional allocations (convex polytope)
- Shortfall = max(0, fair_share - actual_utility), non-negative by definition
- Total shortfall = 0 ↔ proportional (sum of non-negatives = 0 iff all zero)
- Weighted proportionality: generalized for heterogeneous entitlements
- Maximin: maximize minimum utility (Rawlsian fairness)
- Leximin: lexicographic maximin (sorted utility vector comparison)
- Envy-free → proportional (for equal entitlements, axiom)
- Proportional-Pareto optimal: efficient AND proportional (subset of Pareto frontier)
- Key insight: proportionality region has GEOMETRIC structure (convex)

### Fairness-Alignment Tradeoff Analysis (Batch 30 - FAIRNESS ENGINE 5/15)
- Fairness and alignment can FUNDAMENTALLY CONFLICT
- Tradeoff frontier: Pareto-optimal (alignment, fairness) pairs
- Alignment score: how well allocation matches reference (≤ 1)
- Fairness score: inverse of shortfall from proportionality (≤ 1)
- Tradeoff dominance: one point better in both dimensions (irreflexive)
- Compatible: ∃ allocation maximizing both (singleton frontier)
- Price of fairness: alignment loss for perfect fairness
- Price of alignment: fairness loss for perfect alignment
- Genuine tradeoff: reference is unfair AND fair allocations have alignment < 1
- Compromise score: weighted (1-λ)·alignment + λ·fairness
- Optimal compromise lies on frontier (for 0 < λ < 1)
- Key insight: tradeoff frontier has GEOMETRIC structure

### Leximin Geodesics Analysis (Batch 31 - FAIRNESS ENGINE 6/15)
- Allocation space as METRIC SPACE with L1 distance
- Distance properties: symmetric, non-negative, zero iff equal, triangle inequality
- Leximin ordering: sorted utility vectors compared lexicographically
- Leximin optimal: no feasible allocation is leximin-better
- Leximin → maximin (standard social choice result, axiom)
- Geodesic path: shortest path in allocation space
- Straight path = linear interpolation (length = distance)
- Equal allocation: T/n for each agent (leximin-optimal for unconstrained)
- Geodesic to leximin: path toward equal allocation
- Geodesic preserves total: sum unchanged along path (proven)
- Fairness gradient: direction of steepest fairness improvement (transfer max→min)
- Gradient step preserves total (for balanced gradient)
- Gradient flow converges to leximin-optimal (for convex feasible sets)
- Geodesic cost: friction × distance to equal allocation
- Fairness barriers: constraints blocking path to leximin
- Key insight: fairness optimization has GEOMETRIC structure (shortest paths)

### Fairness Barriers Analysis (Batch 32 - FAIRNESS ENGINE 7/15)
- Constraints as TOPOLOGICAL obstructions to fairness
- Barrier = constraint that blocks some fair allocations
- Min share above proportional creates barrier (proven)
- Barrier classification: type (minShare, maxShare, ratio, fixed, external) and severity (soft, hard, legal)
- Distance to satisfaction: 0 if satisfied, positive otherwise
- Feasible allocation has zero barrier load (proven)
- Connected components: allocations reachable without crossing barriers
- Same component is reflexive and symmetric (proven)
- Crossing cost: depends on severity (soft=1x, hard=10x, legal=100x)
- Same-component allocations have zero crossing cost (proven)
- Barrier removal: soft barriers removable, hard/legal require renegotiation
- Fairness achievable by soft removal iff hard barriers satisfied (proven)
- Key insight: barriers have TOPOLOGICAL structure (hypersurfaces in allocation space)

### Individual Fairness Analysis (Batch 34 - FAIRNESS ENGINE 9/15)
- Individual fairness via LIPSCHITZ conditions on treatment functions
- Similarity metric: distance function on individuals (non-negative, symmetric, triangle inequality)
- Lipschitz fairness: |T(i) - T(j)| ≤ L × d(i,j) for all individuals i, j
- L = 0 → identical treatment for everyone (proven)
- Optimal Lipschitz constant: minimum L achieving fairness (computed via sup over pairs)
- Lipschitz violation: max(0, |T(i) - T(j)| - L × d(i,j)) per pair
- Total violation = 0 ↔ Lipschitz fair (proven: sum of non-negatives = 0 iff all zero)
- Approximate fairness: |T(i) - T(j)| ≤ L × d(i,j) + ε (allows small violations)
- Minimum epsilon: smallest ε achieving approximate fairness for fixed L
- Trivial metric: d(i,j) = 0 if i=j, else 1 (maximal Lipschitz constant)
- Individual-group fairness conflict: can't always achieve both (axiom)
- Fairness through awareness: task-relevant similarity metric
- Classification: perfect (L≤1), good (L≤2), moderate (L≤5), poor (L>5)
- Key insight: individual fairness is GEOMETRIC (Lipschitz constraint in metric space)

### Fairness Persistence Analysis (Batch 35 - FAIRNESS ENGINE 10/15)
- First application of PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY to fairness theory
- Parameterized fairness: fairness properties indexed by threshold ε
- Fairness filtration: nested family of fair sets as ε increases (proven)
- Birth threshold: smallest ε where allocation becomes fair
- Death: when fairness feature disappears at higher ε
- Persistence = death - birth (lifetime of fairness feature, proven ≥ 0)
- Persistence diagram: multiset of (birth, death) pairs
- Total persistence: sum of all lifetimes (proven ≥ 0)
- Bottleneck distance: compares fairness profiles (proven symmetric, ≥ 0)
- Stability margin = ε - birth (how much tolerance can decrease)
- Persistence score ∈ [0,1]: fraction of parameter range where fair (proven bounded)
- Uniformly persistent: all criteria have high persistence
- Key insight: ROBUST fairness = HIGH persistence across parameter ranges

- First application of BIFURCATION THEORY to fairness systems
- Fairness state: quantified fairness level ∈ [0,1] (proven bounded)

- Stability analysis via Lyapunov exponents (negative = stable, positive = unstable)
- Attractors: stable fair states that nearby trajectories approach
- Repellers: unstable fair states that trajectories flee
- Basin of attraction: set of allocations evolving to fair state (proven non-empty for attractors)

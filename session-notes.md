# Session Notes - H1 Characterization Proofs

---
## Session: 2026-01-24 (Continuation)

**Theorem:** singleEdge_oneConnected_axiom + review of remaining work
**File:** H1Characterization/Characterization.lean
**Status:** Completed (singleEdge), review of remaining items done

### Work Done
This session was a continuation from a previous context. The `singleEdge_oneConnected_axiom` was completed (converted from axiom to theorem with ~180 lines of proof). The session reviewed remaining work: 3 sorries in ForestCoboundary.lean and 5 axioms in CycleCochain/Definitions.lean.

### Errors Encountered
| Error | Fix | Added to KB? |
|-------|-----|--------------|
| native_decide needed for 0 ≠ 1 | Use native_decide not decide | Yes |
| Walk.noConfusion for ne_nil | Use noConfusion not direct pattern | Yes |
| Sym2.eq_iff for edge equality | Case split on both orderings | Yes |

### Patterns Used
- IsCycle Construction (from hollowTriangle proof)
- Finset Pair Membership Transport
- Case analysis on walk structure (nil vs cons)

### Remaining Work
| Line | Type | Statement | Suggested Approach |
|------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| ForestCoboundary.lean:375 | sorry | pathIntegral_difference_on_edge | Use path uniqueness in forests |
| ForestCoboundary.lean:424 | sorry | cocycle_zero_on_unreachable_component | Show unreachable component is isolated tree |
| ForestCoboundary.lean:477 | sorry | coboundaryWitness_works (reachable case) | Use pathIntegral_difference_on_edge |
| Definitions.lean:90 | axiom | cycleIndicator_is_cocycle | Keep as axiom (topological fact) |
| Definitions.lean:117 | axiom | oriented_edge_coboundary | Has proof in Proofs.lean |
| Definitions.lean:138 | axiom | cycleIndicator_self_contribution | Prove using trail edges_nodup |
| Definitions.lean:182 | axiom | cycleIndicator_sum_length | Prove using self_contribution |
| Definitions.lean:197 | axiom | cycleIndicator_not_coboundary | Has proof in Proofs.lean |
| Characterization.lean:163 | axiom | (was singleEdge_oneConnected_axiom) | COMPLETED |

### Dependencies
- cycleIndicator_self_contribution → cycleIndicator_sum_length (sequential)
- pathIntegral_difference_on_edge → coboundaryWitness_works (sequential)

### Key Insight
For singleEdge acyclicity: any closed walk in a 2-vertex, 1-edge graph must traverse the single edge at least twice to return, violating IsTrail (edges.Nodup). Pattern-match on walk structure and show duplicate edge membership.

### Time Spent
~20 minutes (mostly reviewing continuation context and verifying build)
